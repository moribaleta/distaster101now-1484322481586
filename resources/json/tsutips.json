{"TSUTIPS": [
		{"tip": "Find out if your home, school, workplace or other frequently visited locations are in tsunami hazard areas."},
		{"tip": "Know the height of your street above sea level and the distance of your street from the coast or other high-risk waters. Evacuation orders may be based on these numbers."},
		{"tip": "Plan evacuation routes from your home, school, workplace and other places you could be where tsunamis present a risk. If possible, pick areas 100 feet (30 meters) above sea level or go as far as 2 miles (3 kilometers) inland, away from the coastline. If you cannot get this high or far, go as high or far as you can. Every foot inland or upward may make a difference. You should be able to reach your safe location on foot within 15 minutes."},
		{"tip": "Find out what the school evacuation plan is. Find out if the plan requires you to pick your children up from school or from another location. Telephone lines during a tsunami watch or warning may be overloaded, and routes to and from schools may be jammed."},
		{"tip": "Practice your evacuation routes. Familiarity may save your life. Be able to follow your escape route at night and during inclement weather. Practicing your tsunami survival plan makes the appropriate response more of a reaction, requiring less thinking during an actual emergency."},
		{"tip": "If you are a tourist, familiarize yourself with local tsunami evacuation protocols. You may be able to safely evacuate to the third floor and higher in reinforced concrete hotel structures."}
